## **Currency Converter Web App using HTML, CSS and JavaScript**

This project is regarding building a web app currency converter using HTML, CSS and JavaScript code. 
The project has been planned using an agile modern planning technique. 
The project was broken into serveral iterations, accomodating adaptive planning and continuous improvement of the product. A GitHub project planner was used to keep track of the project progress, assign responsibilities and link with the project.
To allow for accurate tracking of stages in the project, the stages were raised as issues in GitHub and linked to the project.
The first step was to decide the web app to be built.
The second step was to decide which visual design tool to use, i chose to use Figma as i like the simplicity and the areas of CSS code it offers.
The third step was to design a simple currency converter outline in Figma. Keep the design simple, so i can move on to the coding of the product. Here is a screenshot of the initial currency converter design in Figma.
