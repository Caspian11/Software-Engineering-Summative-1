## **Currency Converter Web App using HTML, CSS and JavaScript**

This project is regarding building a web app currency converter using HTML, CSS and JavaScript code. 
The project has been planned using a hybrid of agile and waterfall modern planning techniques. Using a hybrid approached helped me to complete stages of the project in a linear sequential order but allowing for adaptive planning and improvements on the design.
The project was broken into serveral iterations, accomodating adaptive planning and continuous improvement of the product. A GitHub project planner was used to keep track of the project requirments and progress, assign responsibilities and link with the project.
To allow for accurate tracking of stages in the project, the stages were raised as issues in GitHub and linked to the project.

The first step was to decide the web app to be built, as this is my first time in building a web app and using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, i decided to build a currency converter as there are many resources available on this topic.
The second step was to decide which visual design tool to use, i chose to use Figma as i like the simplicity of Figma and the areas of CSS code it offers and Figmas is a free alternative to Jira.
The third step was to create an account and design a simple currency converter outline in Figma. Keep the design simple, so i can move on to the coding of the product. Here is a screenshot of the initial currency converter design in Figma.

Once the initial design was ready, i used Visual Studio Code to write the HTML and CSS code, JavaScript was added at a later date as JavaScript is the functionality and i did not need this to build the visual design of the currency converter. This allowed the project to move forward more quickly as i did not need to build the app end to end before any progress could be viewed.

Figma records the CSS code assigned to each part of design so the CSS code can be reused when coding the web app, this ensures the product coding is the same as the product design in Figma. Unfortunately, figma does not include all of the CSS code or the developer may want to specify an extra feature, this must be written directly into the CSS codespace separetely.
